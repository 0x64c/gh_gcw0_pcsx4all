TODO list

* recompiler:

  - Add proper support for autobias and cycle counting
  - Implement GTE code generation

* constants caching

  For now it's very limited, used by ADDIU, ORI, LUI and memory operations

  - Add constants caching for more opcodes

* register allocator

  For now host registers s0-s7 are allocated, s8 is a pointer to psxRegs

  - Add caching of LO/HI regs
  - Maybe allocate more regs like t4-t7 and save them across calls to HLE?
