Mips-to-mips recompiler by Ulrich Hecht, modified by Dmitry Smagin

What's already done:

 - The whole recompiler is adapted for pcsx4all 2.3
 - Code is greatly cleaned up from dead code and leftovers from arm
   recompiler.
 - Zero register optimizations are removed, since mips has harware
   zero register unlike arm. This reduces code and make it more
   readable.
 - Implemented code generation for DIV/DIVU.
 - Implemented consequent LWL/LWR/SWL/SWR optimizations
 - Implemented consequent stores/writes optimizations
 - Improved constant caching, eliminated useless const reloads
 - GTE code is adapted for new gte core.

TODO list

* recompiler:

  - Add proper support for autobias and cycle counting
  - Implement GTE code generation

* constants caching

  For now it's very limited, used by ADDIU, ORI, LUI and memory operations

  - Add constants caching for more opcodes

* register allocator

  For now host registers s0-s7 are allocated, s8 is a pointer to psxRegs

  - Add caching of LO/HI regs
  - Maybe allocate more regs like t4-t7 and save them across calls to HLE?
